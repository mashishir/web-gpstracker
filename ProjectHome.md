If you have a GPS device and want to track the device on real-time basis on a map, this the application for you.

Written in PHP, Perl, Javascript using apache, mysql a quick and dirty - but working, application.

This project has been in deep storage for some time, however, now with the several queries I have received, I would like to revive this. I invite, people with Php skills to please come forward to contribute to this project and lets make this a better project.

For others, can you please start listing the issues that you found in this application for us to get it resolved.
